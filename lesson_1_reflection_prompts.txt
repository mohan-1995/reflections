How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?


Time saving, helps in indentifying the difference easily and fastly, especially with big files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    
Helps in keeping track of all the changes that had been made in a document.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
pros of Git, it it requires less space as we dont commit each and every step and there by requiring less space for fewer commits
cons of Git, requires manual saving of commits, hence a drawback when user forgets to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
sometimes a group of files in a directory will be linked to one another, which require committs to be performed for all of them, or else it might not result in desired outcome of the project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
git log helps in finding out the entire history of commits that had been made with a unique commid id for each commits, also the git diff helps in finding out the difference between two committs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that 
could break something?

    
it helps a lot finding out the bug in problem and remove them easily. its most helpful in projects that has 1000s of lines.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    
i want to use it for web developing purpose, where commiting files and pulling requests plays an important role, makes work easier and
 social.
